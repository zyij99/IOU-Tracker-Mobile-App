Idea:
iOS/Andriod Mobile App

IOU - Group
app that takes a recipt image and lists all the fees and cost including name of item
the names of participants are customizable and can be assigned to items after indiciating the number of participants
The other members may join in on this IOU and pay directly from it.
feature: calculate the cost that each person owes and display it {name: owe}

Use case: Resturant w/ friends, Uber Rides


Custom options:IOU - Individual
Custom IOUs - create customized IOUs to keep track of who owes you what with option to edit entry and price.
You can invite someone else (assuming the person that owes you money) to this IOU and they'll be able to make payments and see the recipt
Option to include interest over time and that interest will show on virtual recipit for custom IOUs at a rate that the user accepts (for this option both users must consent to this IOU)
There should also be a revision history feature and any significant changes that deal with payment must be verified by both parties (such as a new entry). Alerts via push.

Payment:
when making payment there will be an option to customize your note, it will show the day that the payment was made and any remaining balance owed.

Homepage: Gives signin option and create account option
Once signed in. There is a signout feature, view IOUs, Pay IOUs, Make IOUs
Tabs: Account, Payment Methods, Settings

Implement Light/Dark Mode


App feature:
Individual IOUs and Group IOUs
